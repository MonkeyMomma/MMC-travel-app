# MMFENDTravelApp
 This is the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree Travel App Capstone Project. 
 
I do not recommend Udacity's Programs, however. Their "reviewers" are sexist and have repeatedly accused me of plagerism for submitting my own work. Even if there is only simularities caused by using industry recommended coding styles and layouts, they will accuse of plagerism, especially if you are female. Because of this, I was not able to complete my Nanodegree. I do not recommend giving Udacity any of your hard earned money.


## Overview
This project requires the student to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. The project uses data from multiple APIs and user input to generate travel and weather information for a planned trip. This required extensive research and additional learning to the Nanodegree course content.
