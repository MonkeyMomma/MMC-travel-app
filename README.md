# MMFENDTravelApp
 Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree Travel App Project: Capstone


## Overview
This project requires the student to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. The project uses data from multiple APIs and user input to generate travel and weather information for a planned trip. This required extensive research and additional learning to the Nanodegree course content.
